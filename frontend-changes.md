# Frontend Changes: Code Quality Tools Implementation

## Overview
Added essential code quality tools to the development workflow to ensure consistent code formatting and maintain high code quality standards.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)
Added code quality tools to the dev dependency group:
- **black>=24.0.0** - Automatic code formatting
- **flake8>=7.0.0** - Style and error checking  
- **isort>=5.13.0** - Import sorting
- **mypy>=1.8.0** - Static type checking

### 2. Tool Configuration

#### Black Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)
- Line length: 88 characters
- Target Python version: 3.13
- Excludes common directories (`.git`, `.venv`, `build`, `dist`)

#### isort Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)
- Profile: "black" (compatible with Black formatter)
- Multi-line output mode: 3
- Line length: 88 characters
- Known first-party packages: ["backend"]

#### Flake8 Configuration (`.flake8`)
- Max line length: 88 characters
- Extended ignores: E203, W503 (Black compatibility)
- Excludes: `.git`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `build`, `dist`, `.tox`, `*.egg-info`

#### MyPy Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)
- Python version: 3.13
- Strict type checking enabled
- Ignores missing imports for external libraries: `chromadb`, `sentence_transformers`, `anthropic`

### 3. Development Scripts (`scripts/`)
Created executable shell scripts for common development tasks:

- **`scripts/format.sh`** - Runs Black and isort to format code
- **`scripts/lint.sh`** - Runs Flake8 and MyPy for linting and type checking
- **`scripts/test.sh`** - Runs pytest with verbose output
- **`scripts/check.sh`** - Comprehensive quality check script that runs all tools and provides a summary

### 4. Code Formatting Applied
- Formatted all Python files in `backend/` and `main.py` with Black
- Sorted imports in all Python files with isort
- Applied consistent code style throughout the codebase

### 5. Updated Documentation (`CLAUDE.md`)
Added Code Quality Tools section with:
- Usage instructions for all quality tool scripts
- Overview of each tool's configuration
- Integration into development workflow

## Usage

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Format code
./scripts/format.sh

# Run linting checks
./scripts/lint.sh

# Run all quality checks
./scripts/check.sh

# Run tests only
./scripts/test.sh
```

### Integration with Development Workflow
The quality tools are now integrated into the development process and can be run before commits to ensure code quality. The `check.sh` script provides a comprehensive quality gate that includes:

1. Code formatting verification (Black)
2. Import sorting verification (isort)
3. Style and error checking (Flake8)
4. Static type checking (MyPy)
5. Test execution (pytest)

## Current Status
- âœ… Tools installed and configured
- âœ… Existing code formatted with Black and isort
- âœ… Development scripts created and working
- âœ… Documentation updated
- ðŸ“‹ Code quality issues identified (to be addressed in future PRs)

The tools are working correctly and identifying legitimate code quality issues that can be addressed in future development cycles.
